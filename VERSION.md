* Since version 2.x.y this role no longer installs [EPEL Repository](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) by default, now you need to take care of this, I recommend my role [christiangda.epel_repo](https://galaxy.ansible.com/christiangda/epel_repo) instead
* Since version 2.x.y this role no longer creates [AWS CLI profile (config and credentials)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html), now you need to take care of this, I recommend my roles [christiangda.awscli](https://galaxy.ansible.com/christiangda/awscli) and [christiangda.awscli_configure](https://galaxy.ansible.com/christiangda/awscli_configure) instead.
